m2net, a .NET library to develop [Mongrel2] handlers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[m2net] is a pretty rough port of the python handler libraries included in the
Mongrel2 examples.  It also comes with an even more rough port of the
[Cassini] web server to use m2net instead of sockets.

Dependencies
------------

 - .NET Framework 3.5 (though it probably could be easily changed to use 2.0)
 - [libzmq.dll](http://www.zeromq.org/) (included)
 - [clrzmq](http://github.com/zeromq/clrzmq/) (included)
 - [Jayrock.JSON](http://jayrock.berlios.de/) (included)


License

Currently limitations
---------------------

* Only works with x86 (x64 not supported).
* Probably does not handle text encoding correctly.


Areas for improvement
---------------------

 - See if the recieve socket also does not like multiple threads using it and added a recieve queue if needed.
 - Make the format parsing more correct by doing spliting while messages are still bytes instead of blindly turning all content into ASCII.
 - Complile a 64-bit version of the ZMQ native library and use it with clrzmq to allow for 64-bit handlers.
 - Make the Cassini port more correctly implement the overrides of SimpleWorkerRequest.
